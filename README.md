## Updating the Thumbnail

To update the social media thumbnail (`public/assets/thumbnail.png`), follow these manual steps:

### Steps

1. **Remove unnecessary elements**
   - Delete buttons and elements that should not be present (like background animations)

2. **Set width threshold**
   - Shrink the page to the width threshold where the hero section gets to 1200px width (as recommended in Next.js docs)

3. **Set height**
   - Adjust the height to the recommended 630px (as per Next.js documentation)

4. **Add top padding**
   - Add some top padding to provide breathing room
   - Keep the hero image at the bottom to give the impression it is standing in the border

5. **Fine-tune spacing**
   - Play around with margins and gaps to make it look nice

6. **Final adjustments**
   - Set the section with the recommended width and height (1200px × 630px) to get exact measurements
   - Make final tweaks based on the exact measurements

### Recommended Dimensions

- **Width**: 1200px
- **Height**: 630px

These dimensions follow Next.js documentation recommendations for social media thumbnails/OG images.
