        Hello! I&apos;m Fabricio, a dedicated Computer Engineer with a focus on Web Development at Norsk Gjenvinning. My
        expertise lies in React, Next.js, and Typescript, enhanced by my academic background from UNIFEI and an
        international experience at the University of Toronto. I&apos;m committed to continual learning, especially in
        automation and code optimization, to improve software development practices. Outside of technology, I value
        spending time with my family, exploring films, and enjoying tranquil settings. My experience has enabled me to
        enhance web applications and optimize CI/CD processes, aiming to boost team efficiency, achieve superior
        results, and nurture a positive workplace. My goal is to integrate innovation with efficiency, making a
        meaningful contribution to the technology sector.
